Grooveshark Official API's notes
================================

The main objective of this section is not to document the grooveshark API but
to try to order it in a way that makes me feel confortable with a fantastic
implementation I wonder to have/do.


v3 API methods
--------------

Some notes on the API
---------------------

As you may have noticed, there are several methods that come to be the same. 
Some of them have been deprecated or seem to have been deprecated. I will put
here a use-case on how I plan the API to be used.
>>> cli.catalog.search_song(query='Some song')
>>> song in cli.catalog
>>>
