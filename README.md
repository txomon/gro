Grooveshark official API unofficial implementation
==================================================

This is an implementation of the Grooveshark API, that though I aim to be
supported by grooveshark as it's official Python API, has been just done
using their v3 docs.

It follows a very hard TDD method, so I just can assure that the API specified
in the docs is the one working internally, but I have no way to test it
against the real backend.

I will be uploading it to pypi ASA I get something implemented. My main focus
is to support Broadcasts, as is the thing I definitely most like.

Grooveshark name and such stuff is property of Escape Media Group.
